# Polynomial roots calculator

A simple polynomial roots calculator script written in python.

It uses the Gaus Theorem behind the scenes to find the potential roots of the polynomial. Then it evaluates each potential root in the polynomial to get the result.

## Requirements

- python >=3.6 [download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- pyenv [install it now](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/#installation)

## Instalation

```bash
$ pipenv install
```

## Features

- Rational display of periodic floats
- Square root display of irrational floats (`sqrt(2)` = âˆš2)
- Support for any degree polynomial

## Usage

To perform a run, prompt:

```bash
$ python3 roots.calculator.py
```

## Known issues

- Pending support complex roots for polynomials of greater degree than 2.
- Pending support for complex coefficient polynomial
- Pending support for irrational / rational coefficients (you can multiply your poly coefs by an scalar in the meantime to get rid of denominators)
- Pending support to show if a root is double, triple, etc
